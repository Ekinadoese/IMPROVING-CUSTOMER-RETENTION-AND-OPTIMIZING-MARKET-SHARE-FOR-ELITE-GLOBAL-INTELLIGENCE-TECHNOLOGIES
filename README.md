# IMPROVING-CUSTOMER-RETENTION-AND-OPTIMIZING-MARKET-SHARE-FOR-ELITE-GLOBAL-INTELLIGENCE-TECHNOLOGIES

This project is focused on Investigating how Elite Global Intelligence Technologies can improve customer retention, market share, and ROI by leveraging existing business data.

The EGIT sheet contains 57 entries and 15 columns. Here's a summary of its structure:

Columns:

Date: The date of the record.
Market_Share (%): Percentage of market share.
Retention Rate: Percentage of customer retention.
Process ID: Unique identifier for a process.
Process Name: Name of the process.
Duration (Days): Duration of the process in days.
Error Rate (%): Error percentage during the process.
Resource Utilizations (%): Utilization percentage of resources.
Satisfaction Score (1-10): Customer satisfaction score on a scale of 1 to 10.
Projected Revenue ($): Revenue projected in dollars.
Projected Expenses ($): Expenses projected in dollars.
Penetration Rate (%): Market penetration rate percentage.
ROI (%): Return on investment percentage.
(Customer) Acquisition Cost ($): Cost of acquiring a customer in dollars.
Budget Allocation ($): Budget allocated in dollars

Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Steps to Complete
Data Cleaning:

Ensure all data is correctly formatted (e.g., dates in datetime format).
Check for duplicates and inconsistencies in categorical variables (e.g., Process ID, Process Name).
Confirm data ranges for numeric values make logical sense.
Exploratory Analysis:

Analyze key metrics such as Market Share, Retention Rate, and ROI.
Explore relationships between variables (e.g., correlation between Training Budget Allocation and Retention Rate).
Generate visualizations:
Histograms for distribution.
Scatter plots for relationships.
Heatmaps for correlations.
Deliverables:

Google Slides presentation summarizing the cleaning process, insights, and visualizations.
An EDA report documenting the methodology and findings.
Execution of Project 1
Let me clean and explore the data. Once complete, I'll summarize insights and provide visualizations. Hang tight! ðŸ˜Š


Summary of Findings
Data Cleaning:
No duplicates found in the dataset.
Key numeric columns show valid ranges:
Market Share (%): 0.54 - 1.49
Retention Rate: 18.2 - 21.9
ROI (%): 3 - 6
Satisfaction Score (1-10): 1.5 - 3.5
Dates successfully converted to datetime format.
Exploratory Analysis:
Distributions:

Market Share (%) and Retention Rate are tightly distributed, indicating consistent performance across processes.
Satisfaction scores are skewed toward the lower range, suggesting room for improvement.
Correlation Insights:

Budget Allocation ($) is positively correlated with Retention Rate (
+
0.36
+0.36) and (Customer) Acquisition Cost (
+
0.96
+0.96).
Penetration Rate (%) has a moderate correlation with Projected Revenue ($) (
+
0.38
+0.38).
ROI (%) has a weak negative correlation with Retention Rate (
âˆ’
0.27
âˆ’0.27).
Relationships:

Higher Budget Allocations ($) seem linked to increased Retention Rates.
Processes with higher Penetration Rates (%) tend to yield better ROI (%).
Next Steps:
Detailed Report:

Insights on underperforming areas and potential strategies (e.g., focus on satisfaction improvement).
Cost-benefit analysis of budget allocation for customer retention.
Actionable Recommendations:

Optimize budget allocation to target processes with high ROI potential.
Investigate processes with low satisfaction scores for targeted improvements.
Deliverable Preparation:

Develop a Google Slides summary presentation.
